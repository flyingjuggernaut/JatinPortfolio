                        <b class='mainheadings'>Overview</b>
                        <div class='content'>Followed the entire user-centered design process involving interviews, sketches, 
                        personas and prototypes and came up with an app Tecaid.</div></br>
                        <b class='mainheadings'>What is Tecaid?</b>
                        <div class='content'>Tecaid is an app that helps baby boomers request for timely technical assistance from local neighborhood 
                        high school students looking for community service credit.</div></br>
                        
                        <b class='mainheadings'>Process followed:</b></br>
                        <div class='content'><b class='subheadings'>Problem Statement</b> – Baby boomers struggling to complete daily tasks through the use of technology and 
                        in turn, reaching out to their children as tech support.</div></br>
                        
                        <div class='content'><b class='subheadings'>Competitive analysis</b> – I looked at various competitors working on solving the same problem like 
                        SkillfulSenior.com, Teamviewer, etc. Each one of them assumed that either the elderly person has some knowledge of computer 
                        or has someone to help them in case of technical urgency.</div></br>
                        
                        <div class='content'><b class='subheadings'>Sketches</b> – I started brainstorming the potential solutions by sketching them. Some of the solutions were asking local 
                        children for help, doing google search, asking a librarian, etc.</div></br></br></br>
                       
                        <div style='text-align:center;'><img width="auto" height="900" src="assets/img/portfolio/tecaid/tecaid_1.jpg" alt="" align='middle' width="80%"/></div></br>
                       
                        <div class='content'><b class='subheadings'>Scenario</b> – I came up with a scenario for all my solutions where I thought it could be used. Below is the scenario
                        for my actual solution.</div></br></br></br>
                        
                        <div style='text-align:center;'><img width="auto" height="700" src="assets/img/portfolio/tecaid/tecaid_4.jpg" alt="" align='middle' width="80%"/></div></br>
                        
                        <div class='content'><b class='subheadings'>Personas: </b> – To analyse my solution and making sure that I am designing for my target user during every phase of the design process, I came up with a persona. 
                        It would also help me at the end to measure the success of the product.</div></br></br>
                        
                        <div style='text-align:center;'><img width="auto" height="500" src="assets/img/portfolio/tecaid/tecaid_6.PNG" alt="" align='middle' width="80%"/></div></br>
                                               
                        <div class='content'><b class='subheadings'>Interviews: </b> – I conducted interviews with a few baby boomers and some important things surfaced.</div></br>
                        
                        <div class='content'>1.	Use of watsApp to connect the baby boomers was not encouraged a lot as it was very much dependent on demographics. </div>
                        <div class='content'>2.	The population in this range wants to get their work done as quickly and as much without frustration as possible and they like to ask 
                        for help. For this they consider, library as one of the best resource. </div>
                        <div class='content'>3.	One of the interviewees suggested that there would be a security issue with the primary school children, so why not consider 
                        high school children looking for community service credit.</div>
                        
                        <div class='content'>Thus I shifted my focus to connecting baby boomers to high school children as by the above reasoning, the high school students would have 
                        much more motivation to help and also the security issue is somewhat eliminated.</div></br></br>
                        
                        <div class='content'><b class='subheadings'>Brainstorming: </b> While brainstorming with 2 of my peers: </div></br>
                        <div class='content'>a.	The idea about asking a librarian stuck to us the most as it is free and essentially the work gets delegated to someone else.  </div>
                        <div class='content'>b.	Teaching google search idea came off as something which was very hard to implement but which can have very high impact. </div>
                        <div class='content'>c.	Using Teamviewer to help solve the problem had problems such as what happens when the issue is with connection of physical devices.</div></br>
                        <div style='text-align:center;'><img width="auto" height="300" src="assets/img/portfolio/tecaid/tecaid_5.png" alt="" align='middle'/></div></br>
                        
                        <div class='content'><b class='subheadings'>Paper prototype:</b> I did the QOC analysis, to evaluate the features I want to put in the app and came up with 3 potential 
                        solutions and made paper prototypes out of them. </div></br>
                        
                        <div style='text-align:center;'><img width="auto" height="200" src="assets/img/portfolio/tecaid/tecaid_8.png" alt="" align='middle'/></div></br></br>
                          
                        <div class='content'>I tested my paper prototype with the same baby boomers and my peers to get their feedback. After several round of iterations, 
                        I was able to finalise a solution. Check out the video for the paper prototype <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5Knc2r5ShA' target='_blank'>here</a>.</div></br></br>
                        
                        <div class='content'><b class='subheadings'>Digital prototype:</b> After that I converted the paper prototype into digital prototype to be 
                        developed into an app. Check out the video <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7cAYsU9Rv8' target='_blank'>here</a>.</div></br>
                        
                        <b class='mainheadings'>Did it work?</b></br>
                    
                        <div class='content'>1.	When I showed my app to 3 of the target users, they were extremely excited about the app. They wanted to have it as soon as possible as they said there is a real need for it. </div>
                        <div class='content'>2.	Even checking with my peers, I received acknowledgement saying that this is definitely an issue that needs attention and my concept is something that addresses it really well.</div>
                  
                        <b class='mainheadings'>Learnings from the process:</b></br>
                   
                        <div class='content'>1.	Focus on the need: The solution might change but the need would not.</div>
                        <div class='content'>2.	Always keep your user in mind while designing in every phase of the process.</div>
                        <div class='content'>3.	Getting feedback from target users is extremely important and there feedback supersedes any other type of feedback.</div>
                        <div class='content'>4.	Sketch your ideas in order to get people quickly on the same page as yourself.</div>
