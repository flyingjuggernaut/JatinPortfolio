                            <p class='pdesc' style='padding-top:2%;'>To begin our research, we met with our client for an <span class='fontsegoeb'>initial meeting</span> to have a sense of the companys domain and the problem that they are facing. Through this meeting we <span class='fontsegoeb'>identified a set of key stakeholders</span> that would help us in getting a more thorough grasp on the criticality of the problem. We also got to know the solutions already explored by them in order to curb the problem.</p>
                            <p class='pdesc' style='padding-top:2%;'>For understanding the problem in more depth and at the employee level, we conducted a set of <span class='fontsegoeb'>contextual interviews</span> with the key players involved which in our case were two customers, two employees working on the operations side and one on the administrative side. Following each interview we conducted an <span class='fontsegoeb'>interpretation session</span> of approximately the same duration as the interview, with all the members of the team. During the interpretation session, the key observations, findings, quotes etc. (from the notes and the audio recording of the interview), that could be of relevance were accumulated and stored in a document to be referred to later.</p>
                            <p class='pdesc'>Meanwhile the interviews were going on; each of the team members did <span class='fontsegoeb'>background research</span> on different topics. The topics covered the overview of the client industry, some issues or trends influencing the sector of which our client is a part of, the strengths and weaknesses of the competitors of the client and scholarly research related to the issue being faced by the client. This research helped us in understanding the client industry and to think about the issue from their perspective. With this, our interview questions became more and more specific from being very abstract in the beginning.</p>
                            <p class='pdesc'>The <span class='fontsegoeb'>notes from the interviews were annotated</span> to find out some key things that might have been missed and to deduce the interviewer answer to a question as a whole. To elaborate, most of the times people do not say what they want to say and hence deducing from their language what they meant to say becomes absolutely essential. This gave us some key insights into the interview which were also included in the notes of the interview.</p>
                            <p class='pdesc'>The notes from all the interviews were integrated to form an <span class='fontsegoeb'>affinity wall</span>. An affinity wall is built in order to get all the data relevant to the problem together at one place, which can then be chunked together to find out five or six problem areas.</p>

                            <p class='pdesc'>As a team, we discussed on the two issues to see if anything related to them came up in our respective background research reports. We then <span class='fontsegoeb'>brainstormed</span> for some solutions and in the end came up with our <span class='fontsegoeb'>recommendations</span>, of which one was our primary recommendation that will have the maximum impact with reasonable amount of effort and  two or three secondary recommendations that when implemented will either have low impact or involved a lot of effort. In order to make our recommendations/solutions more concrete, two to three evidence like findings, quotes from interview were used as well.</p>
